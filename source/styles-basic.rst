Basic text styles

This is a subheading.

Links
=========
* single ``*asterisks*`` should get you *italics*
* double ``**asterisks**`` should get you **bolding**
* `python <www.python.org>`_ is a standard link
** but if you encase that same code in two backticks on each side, like this: ```python <www.python.org>`_`` you should get a literal

Lists
=========

* Asterisks for
* unordered lists

1. Use numbers for
2. Ordered lists
  a. Amy isn't thrilled about this requirement, FYI
  b. Craig will tell her to get over it


Directive boxes
======================

.. seealso:: This is a moderately simple **seealso** note.

.. note::  This is a **note** box.

.. tip::  Don't eat yellow snow.

.. warning:: note the space between the directive and the text

.. todo:: We also need to talk about anchors in the text.

About sections
======================

* If under and overline are used, their length must be identical.
* The length of the underline must be at least as long as the title itself

This is a sub-section
------------------------

This is a sub-sub-section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing up sections, there are some conventions.

* ``#`` with overline, for parts
* ``*`` with overline, for chapters
* ``=``, for sections
* ``-``, for subsections
* ``^``, for subsubsections
* ``"``, for paragraphs

.. todo:: We need to discuss whether titles should have over- and under-lines. There are advantages and disadvantages.


Code-related
======================

Inline code is best done by wrapping your code ``in two backticks`` on each side

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <?php echo 'hello world!'; ?>
